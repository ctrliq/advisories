          "text": "It was discovered that python's functions urllib.parse.urlsplit and urllib.parse.urlparse do not properly handle URLs encoded with Punycode/Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), which may result in a wrong domain name (specifically the netloc component of URL - user@domain:port) being returned by those functions. When an application parses user-supplied URLs to store cookies, authentication credentials, or other kind of information, it is possible for an attacker to provide specially crafted URLs to make the application locate host-related information (e.g. cookies, authentication data) and send them to a different host than where it should, unlike if the URLs had been correctly parsed. The result of an attack may vary based on the application."
